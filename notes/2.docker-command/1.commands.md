## To run the container with image
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

Ex:
docker run --name my-container -p 80:3010 my-image-name:1
Here
1. my-container: is name of the container.
2. 80:3010: Map the host system, in case of GCP, The host is local system and on host VM is running.
   So we have mapped 3010 of VM to local 80 port.
3. my-image-name: is the name of the image I have created.
4. 1: is the tag of image.

```

## Run Node js container in detached mode.
Detached mode: Here the process run in the background. Just add -d at with run.
Running without detached mode will block the terminal.

**Note: To run this command, the container should not be initially present even if it is exited.
``` docker rm <container-name>```

```
docker run -d --name my-container -p 80:3010 my-image-name:1
