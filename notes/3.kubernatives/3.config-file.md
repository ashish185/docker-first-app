## Explanation
Required fields
In the .yaml file for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you'll need to set values for the following fields:

'apiVersion' - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object
'kind' - What kind of object you want to create
'metadata' - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace
'spec' - What state you desire for the object
