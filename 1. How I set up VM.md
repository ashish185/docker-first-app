## Linux knowledge.
apt: Advanced Packaging Tool(APT): which is a package management system used in Debian-based Linux distributions. It can be used to perform tasks such as updating the package list, installing software packages, removing software packages, and upgrading packages to newer versions.

## Linux command for Docker installation.

```
>sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io // To ensure docker is not installed
>sudo apt -get update // Ensures all the software in my system is in latest stage.
>docker install// It might not work just write it will give the exact command.
>sudo apt install docker.io
>sudo snap install docker // install the docker dependencies.
```

```
// How to check whether docker is installed properly or not?
>docker --version
>sudo docker run hello-world. // it will pull the image from docker hub
>sudo docker images //It will list down all the images present but it will not show the status for exited images.
>sudo docker images -a //It will list down all the images which are even stopped.
>sudo docker run hello-world.
>docker // will list down docker commnads
```

## Add Current user to docker groups

Every time we are using sudo to access docker things, try to run below command on docker.
> docker images
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/images/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

```
> groups
singhalash185 adm dip video plugdev google-sudoers
//List down all the groups present id docker system.
>man usermod:
It will list down all the commands
>sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$USER will contain the current user.
>exec su -l $USER
To refresh the terminal, basically exec is used to execute new process.
```

## How to know GCP pwd?
>sudo passwd
I have setup: Ash@NagEmpCode
